# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

## Purpose

This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud using logistic regression. The model aims to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or legitimate based on various transaction features.

## Model Overview

The credit card fraud detection model is based on logistic regression, a supervised learning algorithm. It utilizes a binary classification approach to identify fraudulent transactions. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of labeled transactions, distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains transaction details and labels for fraud or non-fraud. It includes approximately X number of entries. Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, the dataset used for this project cannot be provided directly in this repository. However, details about similar datasets and instructions for obtaining them are listed below.

## How to Run the Code

### Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:
- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-LogisticRegression.git
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-LogisticRegression
```

2. Navigate to the code directory:

```bash
cd code
```

3. Run the script for fraud detection:

```bash
python detect_fraud.py
```

### Training the Model (Optional)

To train the logistic regression model using your dataset, you can use the provided scripts. Ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format and then:

```bash
python train_model.py --dataset path/to/your/dataset.csv
```

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Evaluation results and visualizations are included in the code.
